ELK combines three technologies and provides a powerful solution when working with large data sets. In addition, we are able to setup SIEM rules to alert us as defenders to attacks on our organization.

E - Elasticsearch
L - Logstash
K - Kibana
ELK enables defenders to detect attacks and conduct threat hunting.

To learn ELK, we don't need several servers or to spend large sums of money. We can get into the driver's seat and experiment with ELK by using the Elastic Cloud 14-day trial. The trial does not require a credit card to get started. You only need an email and a password.
